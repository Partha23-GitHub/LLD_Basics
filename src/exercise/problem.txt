🛠️ Practice Task: Design a Basic Printer System
🔹 Scenario:
You're asked to design a system for different types of printers in an office.
Each printer can print documents, and some can scan and fax as well.
Every printer has a Display unit and a Cartridge.

✅ Your Objectives:
Use "is-a" where appropriate — for example, if InkjetPrinter is a type of Printer,
use inheritance.

Use "has-a" for components like Cartridge and Display, which are parts of the printer.

📦 Classes to Design:
Start with these — feel free to add more.

Main Entities:
Printer (Base class)

InkjetPrinter (Inherits from Printer)

LaserPrinter (Inherits from Printer)

Components:
Cartridge (used in all printers)

Display (shows messages)

Scanner (optional, for printers with scanning ability)

FaxMachine (optional, for printers with faxing ability)
