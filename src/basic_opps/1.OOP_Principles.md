# 🧱 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Principles

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a paradigm that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. Here are the four core principles of OOP:

---

## 1. 🔐 Encapsulation

**Definition:**  
Encapsulation is the concept of **wrapping data (variables) and methods (functions)** that operate on the data into a single unit — the **class**. It also restricts direct access to some of the object's components.

**Key Idea:**  
Hide internal implementation and expose only what’s necessary.

**Java Example:**
```java
class BankAccount {
    private double balance;

    public void deposit(double amount) {
        if (amount > 0) balance += amount;
    }

    public double getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Protects internal state.
- Prevents unauthorized access/modification.
- Simplifies object interaction.

---

## 2. 🎭 Abstraction

**Definition:**  
Abstraction means **hiding internal implementation** and showing only the **essential features** of the object.

**Key Idea:**  
Expose *what* an object does, not *how* it does it.

**Real-World Example:**  
Driving a car: You interact with the steering wheel, accelerator, etc., without knowing the engine mechanics.

**Java Example:**
```java
abstract class Animal {
    abstract void makeSound();
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Bark");
    }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Reduces complexity.
- Improves code clarity and maintainability.
- Enables multiple implementations behind a common interface.

---

## 3. 🧬 Inheritance

**Definition:**  
Inheritance allows one class (child/subclass) to inherit the properties and behaviors of another class (parent/superclass).

**Key Idea:**  
Establish an "is-a" relationship between classes.

**Java Example:**
```java
class Vehicle {
    void start() {
        System.out.println("Vehicle starting");
    }
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
    void playMusic() {
        System.out.println("Playing music");
    }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Promotes code reuse.
- Enables hierarchical classifications.
- Reduces redundancy.

---

## 4. 🌀 Polymorphism

**Definition:**  
Polymorphism allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class rather than their actual class. It enables **a single interface to represent different underlying forms** (data types).

### Types of Polymorphism:
- **Compile-time (Static) Polymorphism:** Method Overloading
- **Runtime (Dynamic) Polymorphism:** Method Overriding

**Java Example (Method Overriding):**
```java
class Animal {
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Animal sound");
    }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Meow");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal a = new Cat(); // Upcasting
        a.makeSound();        // Output: Meow
    }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Promotes flexibility and extensibility.
- Enables code generalization.
- Simplifies interface usage.

|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Encapsulation | Keep data and code in one unit & hide internals    | Medicine capsule                        |
| Abstraction   | Show only necessary details                         | Car interface: steering, pedals         |
| Inheritance   | One class inherits from another                     | Father → Son (traits inheritance)       |
| Polymorphism  | One interface, many forms                           | One person: employee, parent, friend    |

## 🧠 Rule of Thumb

> **Encapsulation** protects data.  
> **Abstraction** hides complexity.  
> **Inheritance** promotes reuse.  
> **Polymorphism** promotes flexibility.

# 🔗 "is-a" vs "has-a" Relationships in Object-Oriented Programming

Understanding relationships between classes is fundamental in OOP. Two primary types of relationships are:

- **"is-a"** — Represents **inheritance**.
- **"has-a"** — Represents **composition** or **aggregation**.

---

## ✅ "is-a" Relationship (Inheritance)

### 🔹 Definition:
An "is-a" relationship exists when a subclass inherits from a superclass. It indicates that one class is a **specialized type** of another class.

> A **Dog is an Animal** → `Dog extends Animal`

### 🔹 Java Example:
```java
class Animal {
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("Eating...");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("Barking...");
    }
}
```

### 🔹 Key Characteristics:
- Uses the `extends` keyword in Java.
- Forms a parent-child hierarchy.
- Promotes code reuse.

### 🔹 Test Example:
```java
Dog dog = new Dog();
System.out.println(dog instanceof Animal); // true
```

---

## ✅ "has-a" Relationship (Composition / Aggregation)

### 🔹 Definition:
A "has-a" relationship exists when a class contains **references to other classes** as fields. It shows that one class **owns or uses** another class.

> A **Car has an Engine** → `Car` class contains an `Engine` object

### 🔹 Java Example:
```java
class Engine {
    void start() {
        System.out.println("Engine started");
    }
}

class Car {
    private Engine engine = new Engine(); // Composition

    void startCar() {
        engine.start();
        System.out.println("Car is running");
    }
}
```

### 🔹 Key Characteristics:
- Uses composition: object references in member variables.
- Promotes modular and flexible design.
- Preferred over inheritance in many scenarios (favor composition over inheritance).

## 🧠 Summary Table

| Feature             | "is-a" (Inheritance)                | "has-a" (Composition)                  |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Relationship Type   | Parent–Child                        | Whole–Part                             |
| Code Structure      | `extends` keyword                   | Class members (object instances)       |
| Reusability         | High, but can be rigid              | High and more flexible                 |
| Example             | Dog is an Animal                    | Car has an Engine                      |
| Coupling            | Tightly coupled                     | Loosely coupled                        |

---

## 🔄 When to Use What?

### Use **"is-a"** when:
- There’s a natural hierarchical relationship.
- You want to inherit and extend base class behavior.

### Use **"has-a"** when:
- You want to **compose** objects with functionality.
- You need **loose coupling** and flexibility.
- The relationship is more about **using** than **being**.

|------------------------|-------------------|------------------------------------|
| A Dog is an Animal     | is-a              | `Dog extends Animal`               |
| A Car has an Engine    | has-a             | `Car` contains `Engine` instance   |
| A Library has Books    | has-a             | `Library` contains `Book` list     |
| A Manager is an Employee| is-a             | `Manager extends Employee`         |
